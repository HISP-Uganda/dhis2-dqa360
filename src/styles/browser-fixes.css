/**
 * Browser-specific CSS fixes to suppress warnings
 * 
 * This file addresses the StyleSheet warnings that occur when CSS-in-JS libraries
 * (like styled-components or @dhis2/ui) try to inject CSS rules containing
 * Mozilla-specific pseudo-elements in non-Firefox browsers.
 * 
 * The warnings occur because browsers reject CSS rules that contain unknown
 * pseudo-elements, but CSS-in-JS libraries inject them anyway.
 */

/*
 * The actual solution is to prevent the CSS-in-JS library from injecting
 * these problematic rules in the first place. Since we can't easily modify
 * the library behavior, we'll provide a JavaScript solution instead.
